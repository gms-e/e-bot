you can now see the guts of everyone's favorite bot!
e bot, the latest automation in harassing your friends.
(for legal reasons that's a joke, please don't report me. ;-;)
(that would be so sad and e would play yoshi and me.)

anyways, this repo is missing some files:
bot key isn't here because that would be problamatic,
uncensored yoshi and me's are missing,
all the quotes, and HighScore.txt
I'll probably add dummy files for them later so the bot doesn't crash and burn since they're missing.

Doors of doom...works, probably. I haven't *tested* it all too much, but it worked as expected.
(I forgot to clear the labels of correct and wrong door I used for testing actually... oops)


Doors of scores still doesn't really exist, but it should just be a matter of tweaking genViewList
to give some views that don't intersect with views from doors of doom, and adding an if statement
that prevents you from sending the interaction if it's the same day as your last run.
