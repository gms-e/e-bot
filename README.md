you can now see the guts of everyone's favorite bot!
e bot, the latest automation in harassing your friends.
(for legal reasons that's a joke, please don't report me. ;-;)
(that would be so sad and e would play yoshi and me.)

anyways, this repo is missing some files:
bot key isn't here because that would be problamatic,
uncensored yoshi and me's are missing,
all the quotes, and HighScore.txt
I'll probably add dummy files for them later so the bot doesn't crash and burn since they're missing.

As of now, doors of doom is broken, doors of scores doesn't really exist, but everything else is functional
(as far as I'm aware)              (except bluff, that's also broken I believe)
